create a route which renders a page that includes socket.io

send 'hello world' to the client socket, then respond with 'thanks' and disconnect from the server

err handling:
1) surpressing errorss
process.on('uncaughtException', function(err) {
	// log it!
	console.dir(err);
	// you may exit
	process.exit(1);
})


2) handle err via event - catches any thrown things
req.on("error", function(err) {
	// safely handle this if possible
})

*) putting callback code in try-catch doesn't help, thrown outside of callback, before reaching it


3) once()
*) after happenned once => cancels and cleans up everything

4) ?

5) upstart
*) cloudcick script

6) forever
